# Gatsby Hands-On Tasks for Interns

We want everyone to get familiar with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) by doing a small Proof of Concept (POC) and practicing essential concepts. Below are the tasks to follow.

---

## 📌 Introduction to Gatsby
- Gatsby is a **React-based open-source framework** for creating fast, secure, and powerful websites and apps.  
- It uses **GraphQL** to fetch data from various sources (Markdown, CMS, APIs, databases).  
- Provides features like:
  - **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
  - **Performance optimization**
  - **Image optimization**
  - **Plugins and themes support**
- Ideal for building **blogs, documentation, landing pages, and JAMstack websites**.

---

## ✅ Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup
- Install **Node.js** (LTS version).
- Install **Gatsby CLI** globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g gatsby-cli

# Gatsby POC Site

Bilal, perfect—let’s add your README.md file directly from CMD. Follow these exact steps:



📝 Step 1: Create the README.md File

In your Gatsby project folder (C:\\Users\\bilal\\gatsby-poc-site), run:

This creates a file and adds the first line. Now let’s add more content.



🧾 Step 2: Open README.md in Notepad

Run this command to open the file in Notepad:
